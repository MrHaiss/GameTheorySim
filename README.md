# GameTheorySim
 Game theory is a framework for trying to model how individuals in a situation may respond or interact with each other given a fixed set of known outcomes.
 
This project is an agent-based model written using primarily mesa. It simulates 2 different types of strategy in a resource constrained environment, where both agents require food to stay "alive" and "reproduce". Various agent/model parameters can be controlled through global variables to influence the environment. Users can observe the agents moving around on the grid and also view a real-time chart showing the ratio between the 2 strategies. If all agents die, the simulation will stop.
